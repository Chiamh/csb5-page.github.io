I am a budding researcher passionate about understanding how the microbiome affects various aspects of our health. Most of my time is spent at the bench, extracting nucleic acids, building libraries for sequencing, and obsessing over why my experiments didn't go the way they should.

Beyond the lab, I love traveling, reading, photography, and spending time with my loved ones.
