I want to make sense of large quantities of data to generate insights about human health and biology. This involves asking testable hypotheses, generating high quality data and using appropriate statistical and computational methods. 

My current research interests involve using new genomic technologies to understand the function of microorganisms that colonize the human body. This ranges from uncovering what these microbes produce (transcriptomics) to how they are distributed within human tissue (spatial metagenomics). 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family (all the best for working dads!), cooking, experimenting with new recipes and travelling.
