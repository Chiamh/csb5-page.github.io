A researcher with a passion for project management, sustainability, and finding beauty in the complexity of nature. My current project aims to understand and characterise the complex factors influencing the relationship between microbes, ectomycorrizae, and dipterocarps. With this knowledge we can protect Singapore's natural capital as it pushes for re-greening its urban areas. Outside of the lab, I enjoy all manner of creative pursuits.
