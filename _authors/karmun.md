Keen interest in bridging the gap between research and clinical application to help translate scientific discoveries into real-world healthcare solutions. I specialise in sample processing for metagenomics sequencing, nanopore sequencing and project planning. When not working on the bench, I obsess over lab management and my procurement excel sheet.
