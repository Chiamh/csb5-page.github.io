I am a science lover who wishes to contribute to society's scientific development in any way I can. Currently, I am exploring deep learning methods for nanopore signal analysis and genomics data. I am also an enthusiast in research using Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare and Medical applications. Previously, in my PhD and MSc, I worked with action recognition in videos, using RGB data and Pose/skeleton information. In my free time, I love playing football, doing yoga, diving, gaming, and spending time with friends and loved ones.
