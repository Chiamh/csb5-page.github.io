I am the "longest standing member" of the lab and likes the challenge of optimising new protocols. The diversity of projects in this lab has kept me here for over 10 years and even till now, I am continuously learning new skills. Outside of work, I enjoy food hunting, baking, climbing, doing handicrafts and travelling (and more).
