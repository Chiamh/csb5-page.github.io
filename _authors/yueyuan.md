I am a microbiologist and genetic engineer with a strong interest in bacterial diversity and polymicrobial interactions. My current work focuses on high-throughput isolation of bacteria from diverse samples to better understand how different species interact and impact human health and the environment.  

Outside the lab, I enjoy travelingâ€”especially immersing myself in the beauty of natural landscapes, which inspires both reflection and curiosity in my scientific journey.
