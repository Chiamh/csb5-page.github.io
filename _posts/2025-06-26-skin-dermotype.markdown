Super thrilled to share our labor of love from the Asian Skin Microbiome Program! Collected >3,500 skin samples, built metagenomic libraries w/ >70 billion reads and >10TB of data to study population heterogeneity in skin microbiome (200 adults, 18 sites).

Many exciting results to follow-up on:

1. The skin microbiome has unique “types” in every site - we call them dermotypes. The underarm has as many as 5 distinct ones defined by diverse microbes. We built ML classifiers to predict them w/ near-perfect accuracy with 5 species!

2. Dermotypes are highly coordinated across sites. For some sites, we can predict the dermotype just by knowing dermotype of another site. Left and right sides of the body are also highly correlated, suggesting that individual intrinsic factors strongly shape the skin microbiome.

3. Microbes behave very differently across dermotypes in terms of who they co-occur with! We can confirm this with culture-based experiments that show that oxygen gradients and nutrient availability likely shape why we see distinct dermotypes in various individuals.

4. Dermotypes exhibit distinct associations w/ host, where ethnicity and gender play a role in some cases, while others are linked to skincare behaviors. Skin sensitivity, itch and eczema may be affected by dermotype function, highlighting utility for patient stratification & Tx

5. Exciting days ahead as we try to decipher the contributions of diverse factors that shape skin microbiome dermotypes, and in turn their influence on skin health!
