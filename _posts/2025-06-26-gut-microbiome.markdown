Antibiotic use and our changing diet/lifestyles unfortunately have inflicted collateral damage on the teeming microbial ecosystems in our gut (link to microbiome recovery). We are studying how these changes affect our ability to resist colonization by dangerous pathogens (link to INVEST, AMRITAS), and have long-term impact on our health, while identifying novel approaches to restore gut microbial ecology (link to NRF-I?, phage work?).
