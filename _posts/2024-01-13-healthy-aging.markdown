title: Identifying Gut Microbial Hallmarks of Healthy Aging
description: Shotgun metagenomics data for >200 healthy Asian octogenerians helped us identify key gut microbial hallmarks of healthy aging, including some that are only consistently seen in Asian cohorts!

We found a progressive shift in microbiome composition with age, particularly along the y=x axis relative to the first and second principal components of variation.

This shift was driven by a reduction in microbial richness, evenness and Shannon diversity, an observation which was found only in few other cohorts.

At species level, we found major butyrate-producing species are depleted with age (*F. prausnitzii*, *Roseburia*) and instead an alternate pathway with microbial biosynthesis of lysine & conversion to butyrate (*Bacteroides* & *Alistipes* species) appears enriched.

Interestingly, These microbial co-occurrence networks differ quite strikingly between elderly and the young groups, with a shared pattern of cliques formed by the usual butyrate producers and Alistipes species.

Further, at the microbial pathway level, we observed an expansion in the metabolic potential of butyrate synthesis pathways, particularly from L-lysine precursors.

Congruently, (meta)Genome assemblies further confirmed this metabolic potential expansion where it showed many genomes of *Bacteroides* and *Alistipes* species harbor complete pathways for lysine biosynthesis & metabolic network analysis showed that lysine-to-butyrate conversion are reachable.

Leveraging the power of our unique large cohort of elderly, we identified several interesting microbial associations with host phenotypes that can impact healthy aging.

Our study is one of the largest gut #microbiome analyses in Asian octogenarians, highlighting key microbes involved in healthy aging.
