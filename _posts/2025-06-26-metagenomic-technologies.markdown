The ecology and function of the unseen microbial world is hard to study because of its scale and complexity. We develop wet-lab and dry-lab technologies that unravel microbial genetic diversity and function at the whole-genome and systems level (link to examples). Our mission is to build predictive AI models that can help us design synthetic communities with new functions.
