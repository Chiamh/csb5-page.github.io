Ever wondered what genes/pathways skin microbes are using in vivo? Are some microbes even transcriptionally active?

We have developed a minimally-invasive protocol to robustly assay gene expression in the skin microbiome *in vivo*! 

Our protocol uses a small number of skin swabs and optimizes RNA preservation and extraction to robustly deliver the first large-scale datasets on the skin metatranscriptome! We observed very high technical reproducibility (r>0.95).

Skin metatranscriptome libraries were strongly enriched for non-rRNA and non-human reads, providing millions of microbial reads across diverse body sites and consistently across individuals.

Strikingly we noted that metatranscriptomes can be very different from metagenomes! The most abundant species at the DNA level can be barely active transcriptionally (*Cutibacterium acnes*), while *Malassezia* fungi can have an outsized contribution to the metatranscriptome.

Also *Malassezia* gene expression changes significantly across even similar sites, adapting strongly to the lipid sources that are available on our scalps and cheek.

We detected expression of many antimicrobial peptides on skin, some of which had site-specific patterns of expression, and most of which have never be studied in vivo on human skin!

A wonderful collaboration as part of the Asian Skin Microbiome Program with 
Minghao Chia & John Common! Skin microbiome research finally enters the metatranscriptomic world. ðŸ˜€

Would love to hear about your experiences in using this protocol!
